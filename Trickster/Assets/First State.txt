You woke up in your room.
A dark and old place, like the rest of rooms and apartment itself.
It is almost midnight, and fun will begin soon.

You can go to the living room. (You may encounter your housemates.) Or you can jump out the window to start night, like you always do.

What you will do?
1) Go to the living room.
2) Jump out the window.
