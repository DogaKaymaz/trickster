  storyText: 'You said, "Come with me."


    Child got excited. "You are gonna help
    me?"


    "Just shut up." You knew it would be hard to take care of this child.
    Bu still... You didn''t want to left him alone in a zone like that. Finedel people
    were monsters. It was hard for you to grew up here. All things you went through...
    You could protect this child from those disgusting things you endured with.


    "My
    names is Uwan," the child said. "And what was your name?"


    You replied,
    "Jura."


    You were thinking about all the hardships wait for you and then
    child held your hand. You walked through the streets of Finedel, together.'
