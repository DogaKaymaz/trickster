  storyText: 'You got angry to the child and clenched his chin harder while lifting
    him up. He made strange noises out of his control. His eyes got bigger and his
    face turned red.


    "Will you tell me now?"


    "Yes," he shouted. "I
    will, please!" You released him. He looked at you with a sad expression.'
