  storyText: 'He called you, "Coward." And took his wallet from Drod''s body. You
    saw him walk away. You turned your head to the child.


    The child shouted,
    "THERE!"


    It was too late. Coner broke your arm. You stabbed him as reflex.
    He fell down while blood was running from his mouth.


    You said, "You shouldn''t
    have tried me," with a cold voice. Then you realized the child who has hugged
    you.


    What are you going to say?


    1) "Begone."


    2) "What is the
    deal with you?"'
