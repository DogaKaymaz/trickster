  storyText: 'You fought with Coner to save the child. He grabbed your arm and broke
    it. You screamed with pain and saw your arm swinging and dislocated. You took
    out your dagger with your solid hand and jumped on his back and cut his throat.
    He was bleeding to death on the ground. You saw someone coming.


    It was
    Drod. He took his wallet from Coner''s corpse and said "Thanks," to you.

    are you going to say?
