  storyText: "You grabbed Drod's shoulder and pulled him back.\r\n\nDrod roared,
    \"He stole my wallet!\"\r\n\nYou replied him calmly, \"It is normal here. You
    should have kept your wallet. We are in Finedel. Stealing, killing, black market
    and even organ trade. It is common and normal.\"\r\n\nDrod laughed mockingliy,
    \"You think I don't know these?\" He squeezed his hand on Coner's throat. \"It
    is also normal kill one, when they stole your wallet.\"\r\nYou pulled him to
    yourself, this time wild and put your dagger on Drod's throat. \"Chill Drod,
    nobody is dying tonight.\"\r\n\n\"You think so?\" You couldn't prevent Coner's
    move and he killed Drod by stabbing in the heart.\r\n\n\"Do you also want to
    die?\" He asked growling. \r\n\nWhat are you going to do?\r\n\n1) \"What the
    fuck are you doing Coner?\"\r\n\n2) Duel Coner."
