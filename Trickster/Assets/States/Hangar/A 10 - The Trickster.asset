  storyText: 'Child said, "It is a Trickster."


    You gulped. A Trickster? You
    clenched your fists. It was bad. Nobody would want to come across to a Trickster.


    They
    were the definition of mystery. Nobody knew whether they have really powers or
    what they''re doing is just an illusion. Since they live in Vhot, it was not
    common to see one of them in Finedel or another places. Even the wild people
    here wouldn''t want to face with them.


    You repeated, "It is a Trickster."


    The
    child nodded. "Will you help me now?"


    What are you going to say?


    1)
    "Why would I? You are with a Trickster."


    2) "And where is this Trickster?"'
