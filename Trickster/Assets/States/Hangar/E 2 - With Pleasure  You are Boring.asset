  storyText: 'You went outside and you came across to Coner. You saw him while he
    was torturing a child.


    You greeted Coner, "Hey!"


    Coner said, "I am
    busy, Jura. Just found my dinner." He licked his lips.


    You asked, "Was
    he alone?" He didn''t answer you and took out his knife to kill the child. He
    probably wants loot him and sell him later.


    What are you going to do?


    1)
    Save the child.


    2) Don''t care the child.'
