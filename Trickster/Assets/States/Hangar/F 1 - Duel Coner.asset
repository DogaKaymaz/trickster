  storyText: 'You said, "I, Jura, challenge you to a duel."


    "You have no chance
    against me!" He said with a big confidence.


    You gave him his own poison
    and asked, "You think so?"


    Your question made him angry and he jumped on
    you. While he was strangling you, you stabbed him on his back. He staggered back,
    groaning in pain. You swooped down on him with a swift movement. He managed to
    break your arm before you plunged your dagger into his heart.


    You heard
    the child''s applause. What are you going to do?


    1) Don''t care the child.


    2)
    "Interesting one. Spill it out child. What is your deal?"'
