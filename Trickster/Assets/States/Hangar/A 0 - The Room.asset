    An old and dark room, like the rest
    of the rooms and apartment itself.


    It is almost midnight, and fun will
    begin soon.



    You can go to the living room. (You may encounter your housemates.)
    Or you can jump out the window to start the night, like you always do.



    What
    are you going to do?


    1) Go to the living room.


    2) Jump out the window.'
