  storyText: 'Child said, "I''m on my own." He was looking shy as hell.


    "You
    think I am stupid?" You asked again, "Who is behind you?"


    "It is no one,"
    he insisted.


    You grabbed his chin. "There is someone who is protecting
    you and you will tell me who. A fragile child as you, alone in Finedel, huh?
    They would eat you alive and then fuck the rest of your pieces."


    The child
    whispered, "Wouldn''t it be more logical if they first fuck and then ate?"

    

    What
    are you going to do?


    1) Laugh.


    2) Get angry.'
